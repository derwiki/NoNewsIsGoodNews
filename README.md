No News Is Good News
================

Chrome extension to permanently disable Facebook's Newsfeed.

Facebook is certainly useful, but sometimes can be overwhelming. This is an attempt at a compromise: you can't post updates or see the Newsfeed, but you can use messaging and view Newsfeed items you get alerts for. Feedback is appreciated, email derewecki@gmail.com or submit a pull request.
