# No News Is Good News

Chrome extension to permanently disable Facebook's Newsfeed.

Facebook is certainly useful, but sometimes can be overwhelming. This is an
attempt at a compromise: you can't post updates or see the Newsfeed, but you can
use messaging and view Newsfeed items you get alerts for. Feedback is
appreciated, email derewecki@gmail.com or submit a pull request.
